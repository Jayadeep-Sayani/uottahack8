  "summary": "Jay demonstrated good baseline knowledge and communication skills, but needs to significantly improve the depth and relevance of their examples to match the expectations for a Principal Account Manager role at Google, particularly regarding scalability and distributed systems. Their answers were too general and lacked the quantifiable impact and specific technical details expected at this level. They also need to better connect their software engineering background to the business needs of account management.",

  "consistency_analysis": "The candidate consistently presented a confident demeanor but struggled to provide sufficiently detailed and relevant examples. Both answers lacked the depth expected for the role and failed to adequately connect past technical experiences to the responsibilities of a Principal Account Manager at Google.",

  "final_recommendation": "Based on your performance, you need to strengthen your responses by providing more specific and quantifiable examples related to scalability and distributed systems, demonstrating a deeper technical understanding relevant to Google's scale. You should also focus on connecting your software engineering experience to the business needs of account management, highlighting how your technical skills can translate into client success. Practice using the STAR method to structure your answers and emphasize the impact of your actions. Finally, work on reducing filler words and increasing your enthusiasm to create a more engaging and convincing presentation.
