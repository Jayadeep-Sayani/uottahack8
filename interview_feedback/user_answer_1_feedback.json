    "Okay, let's break down your answer. The first part of the question asked about your academic journey and how a project deepened your understanding of data structures and algorithms. You mentioned building a GPA tracking app with React, which is good, but it doesn't really highlight your understanding of data structures and algorithms. It would be stronger if you could explain how specific data structures or algorithms were used in that project, or perhaps choose a different project altogether that better demonstrates that knowledge.",
    "The structure of your answer could be improved. You jumped right into describing the project without giving a broader overview of your academic journey or setting the stage. It would be helpful to briefly mention your major, any relevant coursework (especially in data structures and algorithms), and then transition into the project. This provides more context and shows a more complete picture of your background.",
    "Your vocal confidence was good, which is excellent! However, using filler words like 'uh' can detract from your message. Try to be more conscious of these fillers and practice pausing briefly instead. Pauses can actually make you sound more thoughtful and confident, whereas fillers can make you sound uncertain, even if you aren't.",
    "To improve, prepare a specific example that showcases your data structure and algorithm knowledge. Think about a project where you implemented a specific algorithm (like sorting, searching, or graph traversal) or used a particular data structure (like a hash table, tree, or linked list). Describe the problem you were trying to solve, the data structure or algorithm you used, and why you chose that approach. This will directly address the question and show Google your technical skills. Also, remember to tie it all back to your excitement for the Google internship – briefly mention how that specific skill aligns with Google's focus on scalable, user-focused systems."
