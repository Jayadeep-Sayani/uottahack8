    "Jay, it's great you jumped right in, but your introduction felt a little too brief and focused on your current student status. For a Principal Account Manager role, especially at Google, they're really looking for someone with solid experience. While your software engineering background *could* be relevant, you need to explicitly connect your skills and projects to the specific requirements of designing, developing, and optimizing *scalable systems for a platform like Google Search* in a business/account management context. What projects showcase your ability to understand client needs, translate them into technical requirements, and then manage the implementation of a scalable solution?",
    "The structure of your answer was very direct, which isn't bad, but it lacked a narrative. Think about telling a story: 'Here's where I started, here's a key problem I solved that's relevant to Google Search scalability, and here's how that experience prepared me for this role.' You want to walk the interviewer through your journey, highlighting specific achievements and lessons learned, rather than just listing your skills. Imagine framing your experience in the context of a client's needs and the scale challenges they faced.",
    "Your delivery was confident, and that's excellent! You spoke clearly and steadily. However, remember that enthusiasm is contagious. Let your passion for problem-solving and creating scalable solutions shine through. Try varying your tone a bit more to emphasize key points and create a more engaging experience for the interviewer. Think about it as storytelling rather than just reciting qualifications.",
    "To improve, I'd suggest preparing 2-3 specific examples from your projects that demonstrate your ability to think about scalability and optimization in the context of a large-scale system. Frame each example using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result), but add a 'Learning' component at the end ('What I learned from this experience'). Most importantly, practice articulating how these technical experiences translate into the business acumen needed for an account manager role at Google – understanding client needs, proposing solutions, and managing their successful implementation."
