    "Okay, let's talk about your intro. Right now, it's missing a lot of the details that Google is looking for. The question specifically asks about experiences that prepared you to design, develop, and optimize scalable systems for a platform like Google Search. Your answer didn't really touch on that at all. We need to weave those experiences into your career story to make it relevant. Think about projects where you've scaled something, dealt with large datasets, or optimized a system for performance. Even if it wasn't exactly 'Google Search,' the transferable skills are what matter.",
    "The answer, as it stands, also lacks a clear structure. It felt a bit like you were starting to formulate your thoughts on the spot. A good approach is to map out a chronological journey, highlighting key roles and responsibilities. For each role, very briefly mention what you did, and then transition to a story or two that show how you built a scalable system or optimized performance. That way, you're answering the question and showcasing your capabilities in a structured, easy-to-follow manner.",
    "From a delivery perspective, I noticed some hesitation and filler words, which can impact confidence. It's completely normal to have a little bit of that, especially in an interview! But practicing your intro beforehand will really help you feel more comfortable and confident. Try recording yourself and paying attention to when you pause or use filler words like 'um' or 'uh.' Then, focus on smoothing those areas out and replacing them with a brief, natural pause instead.",
    "To improve, let's work together to craft a strong opening statement that addresses the key requirements of the role. Specifically, I would add at least one very relevant project to your overview. For example, you could begin with a brief overview of your background and then say something like, 'In my previous role at [Company], I was responsible for [briefly describe role]. One key project involved scaling our [system/platform] to handle X% more users while simultaneously decreasing latency by Y%. This involved [mention key technologies or strategies like database optimization, caching, load balancing etc.].' This gets right to the heart of what Google is looking for and gives you a solid foundation to build on."
