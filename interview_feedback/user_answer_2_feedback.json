    "Okay, let's talk about that response. Right now, it's not really answering the question about a technical challenge you faced. The prompt is looking for a specific situation where you dealt with a large-scale system and had to ensure its reliability and performance. We need to get into the details of a real project.",
    "To improve the structure, think about using the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. Briefly describe the situation and your role, then focus on the specific technical challenge, what actions you took to address it, and what the results were. This will help you tell a clear and compelling story.",
    "Regarding your delivery, there's definitely room to boost your confidence. The opening phrase 'I mean, up to you guys, uh, if you guys like it' doesn't project a strong or assured presence. Before answering, take a breath, collect your thoughts, and then speak directly and confidently about your experience.",
    "For a stronger answer, prepare a specific example beforehand. Think about a time you worked with a distributed system (perhaps in a previous role involving advertising or online media, given your background). Detail the specific technical problem you faced (e.g., scaling issues, data consistency, latency), the steps you took to address it (mentioning any relevant technologies or methodologies), and the positive outcome you achieved. Quantify the results if possible (e.g., 'reduced latency by X%,' 'increased system capacity by Y%'). Finally, reflect on the key lessons learned from that experience that would be relevant to a Principal Account Manager role at Google."
