    "The question was about a significant *technical* challenge in a *distributed system*, and your answer touched on merge conflicts and bugs. While those are certainly challenges, they're quite general. For a Principal Account Manager role at Google, especially one that involves iteration and optimization at scale, you need to showcase deeper technical understanding. Think about a time when you dealt with scaling issues, data consistency problems across multiple nodes, or latency challenges in a distributed environment. Remember, Google Search operates at immense scale, so the example should reflect that.",
    "The structure of your answer was quite simple. You identified a problem and then offered a solution. To make it more impactful, try structuring your answer using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This would allow you to clearly lay out the context of the challenge, your role in addressing it, the specific actions you took, and the quantifiable results. For example, how did your actions improve the reliability or performance of the system?",
    "Your delivery seemed a little hesitant, particularly when describing the technical challenges. Your speech confidence score suggests you could project more assurance. Even if you're a bit nervous, practicing your answer beforehand can help you sound more confident and fluent. Work on minimizing filler words like \"um\" and brief pauses to keep the listener engaged. Remember, as a Principal Account Manager, you'll need to present confidently to clients.",
    "To improve this answer, brainstorm a few specific, quantifiable examples of technical challenges you've faced with distributed systems. Focus on situations where you had to optimize for performance under heavy load. Then, for each example, outline the problem, the steps you took to resolve it, and the measurable impact of your solution. Also, prepare to explain the underlying technologies and concepts involved. This will demonstrate the technical depth expected at Google."
