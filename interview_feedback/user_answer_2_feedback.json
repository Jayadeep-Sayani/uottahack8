    "Okay, let's break down that answer. The question was really looking for a specific example of when you learned a new technology quickly and integrated it with a team. Right now, your answer is very general – you mentioned group projects and solving problems, but it lacks concrete details. Google wants to hear about your *specific* contributions and how you overcame challenges.",
    "The structure could definitely use some work. Think about using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to tell a clear story. Start by setting the scene (the situation), then describe the task or problem you faced, explain the actions you took (specifically how you learned the technology and integrated your work), and finally, share the positive outcome or what you learned.",
    "Your delivery came across as a bit uncertain, which might make it harder for the interviewer to fully trust your abilities. I noticed a few filler words and pauses. Try to speak a bit more deliberately and confidently. Before answering, take a breath to collect your thoughts, and remember to maintain good posture to project assurance.",
    "To improve, I would suggest preparing a specific story in advance using the STAR method related to learning a new technology. Think about a project where you had to learn a new programming language, framework, or tool quickly. Practice telling the story out loud, focusing on the 'Action' part – how did you *actually* learn it (online courses, documentation, asking for help, etc.)? And be sure to quantify the 'Result' – what was the impact of your contributions? This will make your answer much more compelling and relevant to Google's needs."
