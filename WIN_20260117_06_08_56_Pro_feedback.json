    "Okay, let's break this down. The question asks for a brief 'tell me about yourself' that's relevant to the role and why you're interested in *this* role at Tech Corp. Your answer...didn't really do that. It was a bit of a joke, and while humor can sometimes work, here it missed the mark entirely. We need to replace that with actual information about your skills and experience.",
    "Right now, there's no structure because there's no actual answer. A good structure for this question might be: a quick summary of your most relevant experience (2-3 sentences), a highlight of a project that showcases your skills in scalable systems or API design (connecting it to what Tech Corp does), and then a clear statement of why this specific role appeals to you at this point in your career. Think about what excites you about backend development and the challenges it presents.",
    "Your vocal delivery was pretty confident; you spoke clearly, which is great. However, even confident delivery won't save an answer that doesn't contain actual information. While you seemed sure of yourself, you need to make sure that confidence is directed towards a *real* answer, not a joke that doesn't land. Try to make more consistent eye contact as well to build trust.",
    "To improve, prepare a short 'elevator pitch' that focuses on your relevant experience for this specific role. Research Tech Corp's technology stack and projects. Tailor your answer to show how your skills align with their needs. For example, mention specific technologies you've worked with that they use (if you know them) and highlight your experience with scalable systems and API design. Practice this answer out loud until it feels natural and confident. The goal is to make a solid first impression, not be memorable for the wrong reasons."
