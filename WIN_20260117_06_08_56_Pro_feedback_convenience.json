    "Okay, so right now, your answer doesn't actually describe a technical project or how you solved it. While it's great you're aware of your mannerisms, focusing on joking about looking to the side actually avoids the core of the question. Remember, they're trying to gauge your problem-solving skills and technical abilities relevant to the Software Engineer role at Google. You need to actually *tell* them about a project.",
    "The structure is completely missing because you haven't actually started answering the question. A good structure here would involve briefly introducing the project, outlining the specific technical challenge you faced, detailing the steps you took to overcome it, and highlighting the positive outcome or lessons learned. Think 'Situation, Task, Action, Result' – STAR method.",
    "Your vocal confidence seems pretty good, which is great! However, joking about your side profile, even if meant to be lighthearted, might come across as a bit unprofessional or evasive in this kind of interview. It's important to maintain that confidence while still focusing on providing a substantive answer. Try to keep your eye contact a little more consistent – it shows you're engaged and confident in what you're saying.",
    "To improve, spend some time preparing a short story about a challenging technical project. Think about a time you really had to problem-solve. Practice describing the project, the specific technical obstacle, your step-by-step solution, and the results. Even if you don't have a 'perfect' project, focusing on how you approached the problem and learned is key. Record yourself and see if you can eliminate the filler words and focusing on what you want to say before you actually say it. Then, practice keeping your eye contact more steady while doing so."
